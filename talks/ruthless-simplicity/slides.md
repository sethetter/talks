# Simple is always better

the end!

thanks for coming to my talk

---

ok, first, a few things

----

## Simple / Complex is a spectrum

like most things

----

## Its all very subjective and contextual

something complicated to me might be simple to you

---

## There are no universally correct answers

just some guidelines to help you navigate decisions

---

ok really though

---

# Complexity is bad

right?

----

## What kinds of complexity?

all kinds, but we'll focus on..

- complicated product features
- complicated codebases
- complicated business processes

---

## The effects of complexity

it's bad, remember?

----

### Complex products

- unintuitive, difficult to learn
- take longer to accomplish a goal
- cause friction for users

----

### Complex codebases

- not easily understandable
- fragile and difficult to change
- hard to diagnosis issues

----

### Complex business processes

- difficult to remember
- have more points of failure
- are not easy to teach

---

# Simplicity is good

right?

----

but why?

----

## When things are simple, they are..

- easier to remember
- easier to understand
- easier to do
- easier to...

----

## We have goals to accomplish

complexity gets in the way

---

# When things are complex..

----

## Deploying changes to your product

- several layers of manual approvals
- dangerously copying files to a server
- manually checking for regressions

----

## A new feature for your users

- buried under several menu options
- forms with many fields to fill out
- resulting information is opaque

----

## A new codebase dependency

- provides 10 features, you need 2 of them
- requires significant refactor
- affects unrelated components in the system

---

# When things are simple..

----

## Deploying changes to your web app

- automated testing to verify functionality
- automated deployment on merge
- one click rollbacks if things go wrong

----

## A new feature for your users

- shows up exactly where they expect
- minimize required user action
- transparent about what's happening

----

## A new codebase dependency

- does one thing well
- simple and transparent interface
- drop in without refactoring

---

# These lines can get blurry!

something can be complicated in one way, but simple in another

---

# How does complexity happen?

----

## Complexity bias

a belief that complex ideas are more credible

----

##  Unintended side-effects

not being aware of the complexity you take on

----

## Sunk cost fallacy

also, complacency

---

# When is complexity ok?

or dare I say, even good?

----

## It's worth what you're gaining

does it make something else simple?

- a deploy pipeline that is fully automated
- a product feature that meets a complex user need

_simple implementations would still be better!_

----

## It's effects can be managed

keep it compartmentalized

minimize the need for interaction

----

## You enjoy it

it's ok to nerd out, enjoyment is a worthy goal

----

## It is inevitable

be diligent and discerning

---

# Managing complexity creep

complexity just happens

----

## Stay focused on your goal

the goal is what you want to make simple

----

## Embrace the complexity

educate yourself, understand, then decide

----

## Consider all your options

which ones are simple in the right ways?

----

## Know what you're gaining

"this (feature, tool, process) allows (us, our users) to..."

----

## Evaluate the costs of complexity

- how well does this solve the problem at hand?
- what extra baggage does this bring along?
- who will be responsible for this complexity?
- will this complexity get in the way of future change?

----

## Be ruthless

saying no is a superpower

---

# Taming complexity

since, you known, it's inevitable

----

## Put in the work!

simplicity takes effort

----

## Intentional understanding

document, train, test, etc

----

## Compartmentalize

- wrap it in a simple interface
- let robots handle complex executions

----

## Keep simplifying

reevaluate what you have, improve over time

----

# Simplicity bias

lets make it a thing

---

thanks!

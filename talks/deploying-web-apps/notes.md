- You have an idea for something cool to build on the web
  - How should you build it?
  - How should you launch it?
- What if I choose the wrong tool?
  - Paying more than you have to.
  - Unnecessary complexity.
  - Tons of features you don't need.
  - Less time to focus on your actual idea.
- How do I know what I need?
  - Focus on what you need now, not what you'll need in 5 years.
  - Components of increasing complexity
    - Front end
    - Back end
    - Database
    - Integrations
- Some options
  - No code solutions
    - Forms with Google Form or TypeForm
    - Data with Airtable or Google Sheets
    - Automation with [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
      - Zapier also has no-code data and interface solutions, in beta!
  - Front end only
    - Static sites on Netlify
  - Front end with serverless functions
    - Vercel with Nextjs
  - Managed backend
    - Fly.io, Heroku
  - AWS / GCP / Azure
    - Nuclearjk
- Questions to ask yourself
  - Do I need a front end?
    - Are your users going to interact with a UI?
  - Do I need a database?
  - Do you need to store data?
  - Can you use a managed service like Firebase?
  - Is a no-code datastore like Airtable viable?
  - Do I need a back end?
    - If you need a database, yes
    - If you need a place to hold sensitive data
    - If you need to integrate with other services
      - ..and can't expose your credentials on the front end
  - Do I need to integrate with other services?
    - Send emails, texts, or other SaaS services
    - Will most likely need a backend for this
    - Zapier can help here as well
- What about doing it "The Right Way"?
  - What's the goal of this project?
  - Launching is the most important thing
  - Databases and backends open up security concerns
  - Managing infrastructure is it's own job
- What's the moral of this story?
  - Infrastructure is its own beast. Keep it tame!
  - Only use what you need, you can adapt later.
  - If you need the complexity, keep it tame!

# Deploying Web Apps

---

You've built the **Best App Ever**, and you're ready to share your creation with
the world.

---

---

**How do you choose?**

---

## What if I choose the wrong tool?

---

Paying more than you have to.

---

Unnecessary complexity.

---

Tons of features you don't need.

---

Less time to focus on your actual idea.

---

## How do I know what I need?

---

Focus on what you need now,

not what you'll need in 5 years.

---

## Components of increasing complexity

- Front end
- Back end
- Database
- Integrations

---

## What if I want to do it "The RIght Way"

---

...

---

## Ask the right questions

---

**Do I need a back end?**

- Do you need to store any data?
- Do you need to integrate with any other services?

---

**Do I need a database?**

- Does it have to be a SQL database?
- Can you get by with a no-code data solution like Airtable?

---

**Do I need any other services?**

- Email, text, or push notifications?
- Detailed logging?

---

## Do you need to store any data?

---

## Netlify

Free, convenient hosting for front end applications.

---

## AWS / Google Cloud / Azure

Cloud behemoths. All the power you could ever need.

---

_Don't go this route unless you're sure you need it!_

---

Containers, API Gateways, Serverless, oh my!

---

<img src="/img/aws-services.png" style="max-width:35%">

**161** different services!

---

**Major new infrastructure complexity.**

---

Have an expert on hand, watch billing closely.

---

## We definitely need AWS

If you're going to embrace the complexity..

---

## Infrastructure As Code

Don't get lost in the cloud console.

Define your infrastructure in version controlled files.

---

Terraform, Docker, Ansible, Packer, etc.

---

## Check it out!

- **Terraform**: https://www.terraform.io/
  - Manage your cloud resources.
- **Ansible**: https://www.ansible.com/
  - Configure your servers.
- **Docker**: https://www.docker.com/
  - "Containerize" your app.

# What about migrating later?

---

# Purpose-built platforms

- Shopify for e-commerce
- [other examples]

---

# No code solutions!

- Automation with [Zapier](https://zapier.com)

---

### What's the moral of this story?

---

Infrastructure is it's own beast. Keep it tame!

---

Only use what you need, you can adapt later.

---

Netlify is incredible, get started with that.

---

If you need the complexity, keep it tame!

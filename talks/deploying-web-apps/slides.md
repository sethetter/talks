You've built the **Best App Ever**, and you're ready to share your creation with
the world.

----

**How do you choose?**

---

## What if I choose the wrong tool?

----

Paying more than you have to.

----

Unnecessary complexity.

----

Tons of features you don't need.

----

Less time to focus on your actual idea.

---

## How do I know what I need?

----

Focus on what you need now,

not what you'll need in 5 years.

---

## Ask the right questions

----

**Do I need a back end?**

----

**Do I need a database?**

----

**Do I need any other services?**

Push notifications? Detailed logging? API gateways?

----

**No to all of the above?** Just need a front end?

Choose Netlify.

---

## AWS / Google Cloud / Azure

Cloud behemoths. All the power you could ever need.

----

*Don't go this route unless you're sure you need it!*

----

Containers, API Gateways, Serverless, oh my!

----

<img src="/img/aws-services.png" style="max-width:35%">

**161** different services!

----

**Major new infrastructure complexity.**

----

Have an expert on hand, watch billing closely.

---

## We definitely need AWS

If you're going to embrace the complexity..

---

## Infrastructure As Code

Don't get lost in the cloud console.

Define your infrastructure in version controlled files.

----

Terraform, Docker, Ansible, Packer, etc.

----

## Check it out!

- **Terraform**: https://www.terraform.io/
  - Manage your cloud resources.
- **Ansible**: https://www.ansible.com/
  - Configure your servers.
- **Docker**: https://www.docker.com/
  - "Containerize" your app.

---

### What's the moral of this story?

----

Infrastructure is it's own beast. Keep it tame!

----

Only use what you need, you can adapt later.

----

Netlify is incredible, get started with that.

----

If you need the complexity, keep it tame!

# ❤️ Logs ❤️

---

## Logs are important!

- Engineering is about problem solving
- To solve problems, you need information about the problem
- Logs are the best source of information at your disposal

---

## Spend time investing in your logs

- Structured logging, attach metadata
  - For web apps, attach request IDs
  - Attach other useful information — current layer, etc
- Use logging levels to be able to turn up the detail on demand
  - Leave your debug logging in place as debug statements

---

## Spend time investing in your ability to search those logs

- Local development — keep them tailed, be able to search, pretty print
- Deployed systems — tons of resources on this

---

## Learning to work with your logs

- Know your layers and where to find each layer's logs
- Know the shape of your logs
- Become familiar with important keywords worth searching for

---

## Make it a habit

If something isn't working, the _first_ thing you should do is search your logs

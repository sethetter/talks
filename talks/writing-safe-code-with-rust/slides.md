## What's Rust all about?

----

- Multi-paradigm (Mix of OOP & FP)
- Compiles to a single binary
- No runtime or garbage collector
- Powerful type system, and macros
- Fantastic tools, rich package ecosystem
- Friendly community, great resources

---

## What can I use it for?

----

"Rust is a systems language."

----

- OS level development.
- Embedded programming.
- CLI tooling.
- Game development.
- Web and network services.
- Web front ends, via WASM!

---

## Why would I want to use it?

----

# Safety!

At both the *type* and *memory* levels.

----

# Productivity!

Packages, tooling, and cross-platform compilation.

----

# Support!

Amazon, Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Facebook, etc.

---

Let's talk about "safety"

---

## Memory Safety

----

# Borrow Checker

Strict compiler checking for unsafe memory usage.

----

Why is this a big deal?

----

**70% of all MS security bugs are memory safety issues.**

----

### How does it work?

----

**Tight control of how data is shared.**

Ownership, borrowing, lifetime tracking.

---

## Type Safety

----

Have confidence in your code.

----

- Enums (sum types)
- Traits (type classes)
- Pattern matching
- Option and Result types

----

**More on thinking in types, March 6!**

Noon, at the Advanced Learning Library.

---

## What's the gist of all this?

----

~The compiler~ **Rust** makes you a better developer,

----

..and it's almost **always** a solid choice.

# Types are your friends!

I'm Seth!

----

I've worked in a variety of languages.

----

I have strong **opinions** about types.

---

### What are types?

----

A type defines what we can do with a thing in code.

----

#### Primitive Types

string, number, boolean, function, object

----

#### Domain Specific Types

LoginRequest, SiteUser, BlogPost, SaleReceipt

---

### Types of Type Systems

----

#### Dynamically Typed

- Types determined when the code is run.
- Incompatibilities result in runtime errors.

----

#### Statically Typed

- Types specified (mostly) by you in the code.
- Code is checked for incompatibilities before execution.

----

Many other types of types systems exist.

We're just going to focus on these two for today.

---

#### Arguments for dynamic typing.

----

**Lower friction to getting code written.**

----

**Less restrictive in expressing behavior.**

----

**Reduced complexity, easier to reason about.**

----

_Completely valid arguments, but.._

---

#### Arguments for static typing!

----

**Prevent entire classes of potential failures.**

----

**Ease the refactoring process.**

----

**More information at your fingertips.**
